# payments-react

Minimal Vite + React project for your Payments page converted from payments.html + app.js.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes / Tips

- API base used: `http://localhost:3000/api/payments` (same as your backend)
- This project uses **react-query**, **axios**, **tailwindcss**, **lucide-react**.
- I did not include shadcn/ui because it requires additional setup; UI is built with Tailwind so it runs out-of-the-box.
- If you want a full project with shadcn components, tell me and I can add guidance.
